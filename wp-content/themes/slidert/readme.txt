HOW TO USE THESE FILES

The files provided include:
1. The theme files - This is by no means a complete theme. It simply contains the slider
2. The slider examples -- Taken from Nathan Searles' slidesjs.com and modified (Standard example) 
3. XML content file

Setting up the Portfolio theme

1. Install wordPress on your localhost or server, delete hello world and the sample page. 
2. Install theme and activate.
3. Import the xml document

That's it. Once that's done, you can see how the slider works and implement the code in your next WordPress project.
